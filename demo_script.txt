Demo Script (Target 07/11/2016)

BEFORE THE DEMO
Log into the application. If CMS522v0 exists, delete all patients associated with it. Then delete the CMS522v0 measure.


1. User logs into the application
2. User selects the Upload measure button which brings up the upload dialog.
3. User navigates to the CMS522v0 "Simple Discharged on Antithrombotic Therapy" zip file (testplan/SimpleDischargedOnAntithrombotic.zip)
    - This is NOT a real measure. This is a simplification of CMS72.
4. User selects "Eligible Hospital" on the upload dialog
5. User selects "Episode of Care" on the upload dialog
6. User clicks the Load button to dismiss the dialog. The measure loads and the user is presented with the finalize dialog.
7. On the finalize dialog, the user selects "Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Encounter" as the episode of care.
8. User clicks done to dismiss the finalize dialog.
9. User is returned to the measure dashboard with CMS522v0 loaded.
10. User clicks the measure title to navigate to the measure view.
    On the measure view, the user can see the Measure title, description, and logic.
    (Explain the IPP/DENOM/NUMER fields)
11. User clicks on the icon with a person and plus sign (add patient button) and navigates to the patient builder view.
12. The user names the patient "Ischemic No Meds" and provides an expectation that the patient will have IPP and DENOM values of 1.
13. Based on the logic, the user adds the following to the patient:

  Name: Ischemic, No Meds
  DOB: 10/10/1970 00:00
  Expected Values: IPP, DENOM
  Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Encounter
    start: 11/07/2012 06:00
    end: 11/09/2012 06:00
  Diagnosis: Ischemic Stroke
    start: 11/07/2012 10:00
    no end

  (Explain why this makes the IPP and DENOM true)

14. User saves the patient which takes them to the measure view where they can see the results of the calculation.
15. User clicks on the expansion icon for the patient.
    The user can see the results of the calculation highlighted on the Logic, the fact that there's a 100% match with expectations, and what populations the patient ended up in.
16. With the patient expanded, User clicks the Clone button to clone the patient.
17. User renames the patient to "Ischemic With Meds" and changes the NUMER expected value to 1.
18. User adds the following to the patient

  Name: Ischemic, With Meds
  Expected Values: IPP, DENOM, NUMER
  Medication, Administered: Antithrombotic Therapy
    start: 11/08/2012 05:00
    end: 11/08/2012 06:00
    
  (Explain why this makes the NUMER true)

19. The user saves the patient and is taken to the measure view and can now see two patients.

20. (Explain how the synthetic patients can help show errors in the measure logic)
