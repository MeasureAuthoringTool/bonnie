BEFORE THE DEMO
Log into the application. If CMS72 exists, delete all patients associated with it. Then delete the CMS72 measure.


1. User logs into the application
2. User selects the Upload measure button which brings up the upload dialog.
3. User navigates to the CMS72v5 "Antithrombotic Therapy By End of Hospital Day 2" zip file (testplan/EH_CMS72_v5.zip)
    - This is a relatively simple EH measure with one population that is episode of care
4. User selects "Eligible Hospital" on the upload dialog
5. User selects "Episode of Care" on the upload dialog
6. User clicks the Load button to dismiss the dialog. The measure loads and the user is presented with the finalize dialog.
7. On the finalize dialog, the user selects EncounterInpatientNonElective as the episode of care.
8. User clicks done to dismiss the finalize dialog.
9. User is returned to the measure dashboard with CMS72v5 loaded.
10. User clicks the measure title to navigate to the measure view.
    On the measure view, the user can see the Measure title, description, and logic.
    (Explain the IPP/DENOM/NUMER fields and variables)
11. User clicks on the icon with a person and plus sign (add patient button) and navigates to the patient builder view.
12. The user names the patient "Ischemic No Meds" and provides an expectation that the patient will have IPP and DENOM values of 1.
13. Based on the logic, the user adds the following to the patient:

  Name: Ischemic, No Meds
  DOB: 10/10/1970 00:00
  Expected Values: IPP, DENOM
  Encounter, Performed: Inpatient Encounter
    start: 11/07/2012 06:00
    end: 11/09/2012 06:00
    Field Value: Principal Diagnosis:Ischemic Stroke

  (Explain why this makes the IPP and DENOM true)

14. User saves the patient which takes them to the measure view where they can see the results of the calculation.
15. User clicks on the expansion icon for the patient.

    start: 11/08/2012 05:00

  (Explain why this makes the NUMER true)

19. The user saves the patient and is taken to the measure view and can now see two patients.

20. (Explain how the synthetic patients can help show errors in the measure logic)
