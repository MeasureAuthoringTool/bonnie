Migrating from Backbone.Paginator 1.0
-------------------------------------

Backbone.Paginator 2.0 was originally called backbone-pageable, which in turn
was inspired by Backbone.Paginator < 1.0 by @addyosmani. The two projects have
merged as of May 2014 and backbone-pageable has effectively become
Backbone.Paginator 2.0. This guide describes some of the differences and
similarities to ease migration.

Package Naming
++++++++++++++

Backbone.Paginator 2.0 will continue to use the backbone.paginator name for the
file, ``npm`` and ``bower`` packages. In addition, a new ``component`` package
is also available, also inheriting the backbone.paginator name.

Module Naming
+++++++++++++

The module exported by the packages will still be called ``PageableCollection``
to emphasize the function of this Backbone plugin as a ``Collection`` instead of
a ``View``.

Advantages
----------

Supports client-side and server-side operations
  You can initialize ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` to paginate and/or sort on
  the client-side, server-side or both.
Infinite paging
  Many public APIs like `Github <http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination>`_
  or `Facebook
  <https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/pagination/>`_ support
  infinite paging, ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` can handle them easily.
Comes with reasonable defaults
  Server API parameters preconfigured to work with most Rails RESTful APIs by
  default.
Works well with existing server-side APIs
  Query parameter mappings are all configurable, and you can use either 0-based
  or 1-based indices.
Bi-directional event handling
  In client-mode, any changes done on one page is immediately reflected on the
  others with the appropriate events propagated.
100% compatible with existing code
  ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` is a strict superset of
  ``Backbone.Collection`` and passes its `test suite
  <http://backbone-paginator.github.io/backbone.paginator/test/index.html>`_.
Well tested
  Comes with 100s of tests in addition to the ``Backbone.Collection`` test
  suite.
Well documented
  Use cases and functionality are thoroughly documented.
No surprising behavior
  ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` performs internal state sanity checks at
  appropriate times, so it is next to impossible to get into a weird state.
Light-weight
  The library is only 4.1KB minified and gzipped.

Introduction
------------

Like Backbone.Collection, you can provide a URL endpoint, configure your initial
pagination state and server API mapping by extending
``Backbone.PageableCollection``:

.. code-block:: javascript

  var Book = Backbone.Model.extend({});

  var Books = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({
    model: Book,
    url: "api.mybookstore.com/books",

    // Any `state` or `queryParam` you override in a subclass will be merged with
    // the defaults in `Backbone.PageableCollection` 's prototype.
    state: {

      // You can use 0-based or 1-based indices, the default is 1-based.
      // You can set to 0-based by setting ``firstPage`` to 0.
      firstPage: 0,

      // Set this to the initial page index if different from `firstPage`. Can
      // also be 0-based or 1-based.
      currentPage: 2,

      // Required under server-mode
      totalRecords: 200
    },

    // You can configure the mapping from a `Backbone.PageableCollection#state`
    // key to the query string parameters accepted by your server API.
    queryParams: {

      // `Backbone.PageableCollection#queryParams` converts to ruby's
      // will_paginate keys by default.
      currentPage: "current_page",
      pageSize: "page_size"
    }
  });


You can initialize ``state`` and ``queryParams`` from the constructor too:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var Books = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({
     model: Book,
     url:"api.mybookstore.com/books"
   });

   var books = new Books([], {

     // All the `state` and `queryParams` key value pairs are merged with
     // the defaults too.
     state: {
       firstPage: 0,
       currentPage: 0
     },

     queryParams: {
       currentPage: "current_page",
       pageSize: "page_size"
     }
   });


Adapting to a Server API
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To adapt to an existing server API that do not use ``will_paginate`` keys, you
can configure the ``queryParams`` object hash to map ``state`` keys to the query
parameters your server will accept. Those query parameters will be in the query
string of the URL used for fetching. You can also put extra items into
``queryParams`` and they will be in the query string as is. Setting ``null`` as
the value of any mapping will remove it from the query string. Finally, the
values in the ``queryParams`` can be either a literal value or a parameter-less
function that returns a value.

This is a listing of the default ``state`` and ``queryParam`` values.

============ ===== ============= ============================
    ``state``                   ``queryParams``
------------------ ------------------------------------------
Attribute    Value Attribute     Value
============ ===== ============= ============================
firstPage    1
lastPage     null
currentPage  null  currentPage   "page"
pageSize     25    pageSize      "per_page"
totalPages   null  totalPages    "total_pages"
totalRecords null  totalRecords  "total_entries"
sortKey      null  sortKey       "sort_by"
order        -1    order         "order"
\                  directions    { "-1": "asc", "1": "desc" }
============ ===== ============= ============================

You can consult the `API documentation
<http://backbone-paginator.github.io/backbone.paginator/#!/api/Backbone.PageableCollection>`_
for a detailed explaination of these fields.

Fetching Data and Managing States
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can access the pageable collection's internal state by looking at the
``state`` object attached to it. This state object, however, is generally
read-only after initialization. There are various methods to help you manage
this state, you should use them instead of manually modifying it. For the
unusual circumstances where you need to modify the ``state`` object directly, a
sanity check will be performed at the next time you perform any
pagination-specific operations to ensure internal state consistency.

================================ ===============================================
Method                           Use When
================================ ===============================================
``setPageSize``                  Changing the page size
``setSorting``                   Changing the sorting
``switchMode``                   Switching between modes
``state``                        Need to read the internal state
``get*Page``                     Need to go to a different page
``hasPreviousPage, hasNextPage`` Check if paging backward or forward is possible
================================ ===============================================

In addition to the above methods, you can also synchronize the state with the
server during a fetch. ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` overrides the default
`Backbone.Collection#parse <http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-parse>`_ method to
support an additional response data structure that contains an object hash of
pagination state. The following is a table of the response data structure
formats ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` accepts.

================= ========================================
Without State     With State
================= ========================================
``[{}, {}, ...]`` ``[{ pagination state }, [{}, {} ...]]``
================= ========================================

Most of the time, providing something like this in your response is sufficient
for updating the pagination state.

``[{"total_entries": 100}, [{}, {}, ...]]``

Since 1.1.7, customizing ``parse`` has been simplified and the default
implementation now delegates to two new methods - ``parseState`` and
``parseRecords``. You are encouraged to override them instead of ``parse`` if it
is not clear how to do so. For infinite mode, you should override ``parseLinks``
instead of ``parseState`` to return an object of links.

See the examples below or the `API
<http://backbone-paginator.github.io/backbone.paginator/>`_ for details on
customizing ``parseState``, ``parseRecords`` and ``parseLinks``.

Bootstrapping
-------------

``Backbone.PageableCollection`` is 100% compatible with ``Backbone.Collection``
's interface, so you can bootstrap the models and supply a comparator to the
constructor just like you are used to:

.. code-block:: javascript

  // Bootstrap with just 1 page of data for server-mode, or all the pages for
  // client-mode.
  var books = new Books([
    { name: "A Tale of Two Cities" },
    { name: "Lord of the Rings" },
    // ...
  ], {
    // Paginate and sort on the client side, default is `server`.
    mode: "client",
    // This will maintain the current page in the order the comparator defined
    // on the client-side, regardless of modes.
    comparator: function (model) { return model.get("name"); }
  });


Pagination
----------

Server-Mode
+++++++++++

``Backbone.Pagination`` defaults to server-mode, which means it only holds one
page of data at a time. All of the ``get*page`` operations are done by
delegating to ``fetch``. They return a ``jqXHR`` in this mode.

.. code-block:: javascript

  books.getFirstPage();
  books.getPreviousPage();
  books.getNextPage();
  books.getLastPage();

  // All the `get*Page` methods under server-mode delegates to `fetch`, so you
  // can attach a callback to the returned `jqXHR` objects' `done` event.
  books.getPage(2).done(function () {
    // do something ...
  });


All of the ``get*Page`` methods accept the same options
`Backbone.Collection#fetch <http://backbonejs.org/#Collection-fetch>`_ accepts
under server-mode.


Client-Mode
+++++++++++

Client-mode is a very convenient mode for paginating a handful of pages entirely
on the client side without going through the network page-by-page. This mode is
best suited if you only have a small number of pages so sending all of the data
to the client is not too time-consuming.

.. code-block:: javascript

  var books = new Books([
    // Bootstrap all the records for all the pages here
  ], { mode: "client" });


All of the ``get*Page`` methods reset the pageable collection's data to the models
belonging to the current page and return the collection itself instead of a
``jqXHR``.

.. code-block:: javascript

  // You can immediately operate on the collection without waiting for jQuery to
  // call your `done` callback.
  var json = JSON.stringify(books.getLastPage());

  // You can force a fetch in client-mode to get the most updated data if the
  // collection has gone stale.
  books.getFirstPage({ fetch: true });

  // Do something interesting with books...


Infinite-Mode
+++++++++++++

Infinite paging mode is a hybrid of server mode and client mode. Once
initialized and bootstrapped, paging backwards will be done on the client-side
by default while paging forward will be done by fetching.

As before, you can make use of ``getFirstPage``, ``getPreviousPage``,
``getNextPage``, and ``getLastPage`` for navigation under infinite-mode. If a
page has been fetched, you can use ``getPage`` directly with the page number, an
error will be thrown if the page has not been fetched yet.

By default, ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` parses the response headers to find
out what the ``first``, ``next`` and ``prev`` links are. The parsed links are
available in the ``links`` field.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var Issues = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({
     url: "https://api.github.com/repos/documentclound/backbone/issues?state=closed",
     mode: "infinite"

     // Initial pagination states
     state: {
       pageSize: 15,
       sortKey: "updated",
       order: 1
     },

     // You can remap the query parameters from ``state`` keys from the default
     // to those your server supports. Setting ``null`` on queryParams removed them
     // from being appended to the request URLs.
     queryParams: {
       totalPages: null,
       totalRecords: null,
       sortKey: "sort",
       order: "direction",
       directions: {
         "-1": "asc",
         "1": "desc"
       }
     }

   });

   var issues = new Issues();

   issues.getFirstPage().done(function () {
      // do something interesting...
   });

If your server API does not return the links using the ``Link`` header like
`Github <http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination>`_ does, you can subclass
``Backbone.PageableCollection`` to override the ``parseLinks`` methods to
return a links object.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var FBComment = Backbone.Model.extend({});

   var FBComments = Backbone.PageableCollection.extend({
     model: FBComment,
     url: "https://graph.facebook.com/A_REALLY_LONG_FACEBOOK_OBJECT_ID",
     mode: "infinite",
     // Set the indices to 0-based for Graph API.
     state: {
       firstPage: 0
     },
     queryParams: {
       pageSize: "limit",
       // Setting a parameter mapping value to null removes it from the query string
       currentPage: null,
       // Any extra query string parameters are sent as is, values can be functions,
       // which will be bound to the pageable collection instance temporarily
       // when called.
       offset: function () { return this.state.currentPage * this.state.pageSize; }
     },
     // Return all the comments for this Facebook object
     parseRecords: function (resp) {
       return resp.comments.data;
     },
     // Facebook's `paging` object is in the exact format
     // `Backbone.PageableCollection` accepts.
     parseLinks: function (resp, xhr) {
       return resp.comments.paging;
     }
   });

To act on the newly fetched models under infinite mode, you can listen to the
``fullCollection`` reference's ``add`` event like you would under client mode,
and render the newly fetched models accordingly.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var ToiletPaper = Backbone.View.extend({

     events: {
       "scroll": "fetchSheets"
     },

     initialize: function (options) {
       this.listenTo(this.collection.fullCollection, "add", this.addSheet);
     },

     addSheet: function () {
       // ...
     },

     fetchSheets: function () {
       this.collection.getNextPage();
     },

     // ...

   });

   var wordsOfTheDay = new Backbone.PageableCollection({
     mode: "infinite",
     // url, initial state, etc...
   });

   var toiletPaper = new ToiletPaper({collection: wordsOfTheDay});

   $("#toilet-paper-dispenser").append(toiletPaper.render().el);

   wordsOfTheDay.fetch();


Note:
+++++

**Don't** override ``parseState`` or send down a stateful list of records from
the server.

Under infinite mode, ``totalRecords`` will always equal to the number of models
inside ``fullCollection`` i.e. ``fullCollection.length``. PagebleCollection will
automatically keep all the states consistent. Modifying the state during
infinite paging results in undefined behavior. As such, you shouldn't override
``parseState`` and should only send down a stateless list of records as
described in `Fetching Data and Managing States`_.


Sorting
-------

Sorting has been drastically simplified in the 1.0 release while retaining the
full power it had in older versions.

The main way to define a sorting for a pageable collection is to utilize the
``setSorting`` method.  Given a ``sortKey`` and an ``order``, ``setSorting``
sets ``state.sortKey`` and ``state.order`` to the given values. If ``order`` is
not given, ``state.order`` is assumed. By default a comparator is applied to the
full collection under client mode. Calling ``sort`` on the full collection will
then get the entire pageable collection sorted globally. When operating under
server or infinite mode, no comparator will be applied to the collection as
sorting is assumed to be done on the server by default. Set ``options.full`` to
``false`` to apply a comparator to the current page under any mode. To sort a
pageable collection under infinite mode on the client side, set ``options.side``
to ``"client"`` will apply a comparator to the full collection.

Setting ``sortKey`` to ``null`` removes the comparator from both the current
page and the full collection.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var books = new Books([
     ...
   ], {
     mode: "client"
   });

   // Sets a comparator on `#fullCollection` that sorts the title in ascending
   // order
   books.setSorting("title");

   // Don't forget to call `sort` just like you would on a `Backbone.Collection`
   books.fullCollection.sort();

   // Clears the comparator
   books.setSorting(null);

   // Sets a comparator on the current page that sorts the title in descending
   // order
   books.setSorting("title", 1, {full: false})
   books.sort();

   books.switchMode("infinite");

   // Sorts the books collection under infinite paging mode on the client side
   books.setSorting("title", -1, {side: "client"});
   books.fullCollection.sort();

   books.switchMode("server");

   // Sets a comparator on the current page under server mode
   books.setSorting("title", {side: "client", full: false});
   books.sort();

Manipulation
------------

This is one of the areas where ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` truely shines. A
``Backbone.PageableCollection`` instance not only can do everything a plain
``Backbone.Collection`` can for the current page, in client-mode, it can also
synchronize changes and events across all of the pages. For example, you can add
or remove a model from either a ``Backbone.PageableCollection`` instance, which
is holding the current page, or the
``Backbone.PageableCollection#fullCollection`` collection, which is a plain
``Backbone.Collection`` holding the models for all of the pages, and the pages
will all update themselves to maintain within a page size. Any additions,
removals, resets, model attribute changes and synchronization actions are
communicated between all the pages throught the two collections.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // The books collection is initialized to start at the first page.
   var books = new Books([
     // bootstrap with all of the models for all of the pages here
   ], {
     mode: "client"
   });

   // A book is added to the end of the current page, which will overflow to the
   // next page and trigger an `add` event on `fullCollection`.
   books.push({ name: "The Great Gatsby"});

   books.fullCollection.at(books.state.currentPage - 1 * books.state.pageSize).get("name");
   >>> "The Great Gatsby"

   // Add a new book to the beginning of the first page.
   books.fullCollection.unshift({ name: "Oliver Twist" });
   books.at(0).get("name");
   >>> "Oliver Twist"

FAQ
---

#. Which package managers does backbone.paginator support?

   bower, npm, CommonJS and AMD and Component.

#. Why doesn't backbone.paginator support filtering?

   Wheels should be reinvented only when they are crooked. backbone.paginator aims
   to do one thing only and does it well, which is pagination and sorting. Besides,
   since Backbone.PageableCollection is 100% compatible with Backbone.Collection,
   you can do filtering fairly easily with Backbone's built-in support for
   Underscore.js methods.
