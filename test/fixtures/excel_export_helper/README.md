## Excel Export Helper Fixtures
These fixtures were generated by putting a debugger in at app/assets/javascripts/views/measure_view.js.coffee
function exportExcelPatients and grabbing the objects after running the excel export on the front end
from CMS903v0 on the bonnie-fixtures@mitre.org account.

JSON.stringify(calc_results, null, 2)
JSON.stringify(patient_details, null, 2)
JSON.stringify(population_details, null, 2)
JSON.stringify(statement_details, null, 2)

The unpretty versions were created in the same way after removing the doPretty: true option and
commenting out the "options.doPretty = true # force doPretty to true" line of cqm_calculator.js.coffee
```
result = pop.calculate(patient, {doPretty: true})
```


CMS903-results-stub.json represents the results from CMS903
and was made by replacing the contents of the "is correct for patient with no episodes" test in
cqm-execution/spec/models/calculator_spec.js with the below code, copying over the CMS903 fixutres temporarily into you local cqm-execution repo and setting a breakpoint at the end of this test to run 'JSON.stringify(calculationResults, null, 2)' in the debug console for the fixture's content
(make sure to run `yarn install` and verify your branch in cqm-execution before generating the fixture)
```
const valueSets = getJSONFixture('cqm_measures/CMS903v0/value_sets.json');
valueSetsArray = valueSets['4DC3E7AA-8777-4749-A1E4-37E942036076'];
const measure = getJSONFixture('cqm_measures/CMS903v0/CMS903v0.json');
const patients = [];
patients.push(getJSONFixture('patients/CMS903v0/Visit_1 ED.json').qdmPatient);
patients.push(getJSONFixture('patients/CMS903v0/Visits_2 ED.json').qdmPatient);
patients.push(getJSONFixture('patients/CMS903v0/Visits 1 Excl_2 ED.json').qdmPatient);
patients.push(getJSONFixture('patients/CMS903v0/Visits 2 Excl_2 ED.json').qdmPatient);
const options = { doPretty: true, requestDocument: false }
const calculationResults = Calculator.calculate(measure, patients, valueSetsArray, options);
```

CMS903-unpretty-results-stub.json represents the results from CMS903 without using doPretty: true
and was made by following the instructureions from the above CMS903-results-stub.json fixture and setting the 'doPretty' flag in the options object to false

CMS134-results-stub represents the results from CMS134
and was made by doing JSON.stringify(calculationResults, null, 2) after putting a breakpoint
in cqm-execution/spec/models/calculator_spec.js on branch bonnie_backend_execution
