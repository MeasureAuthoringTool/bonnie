## Excel Export Helper Fixtures
These fixtures were generated by putting a debugger in at app/assets/javascripts/views/measure_view.js.coffee
function exportExcelPatients and grabbing the objects after running the excel export on the front end
from CMS32v7 on the bonnie-fixtures@mitre.org account.


JSON.stringify(calc_results, null, 2)
JSON.stringify(patient_details, null, 2)
JSON.stringify(population_details, null, 2)
JSON.stringify(statement_details, null, 2)

The unpretty versions were created in the same way after removing the doPretty: true option:
```
result = pop.calculate(patient, {doPretty: true})
```

CMS32-results-stub.json represents the results from CMS32
and was made by doing JSON.stringify(visit1EdResults, null, 2) after putting a breakpoint
in cqm-execution/spec/models/calculator_spec.js on branch bonnie_backend_execution_results_stub

CMS32-unpretty-results-stub.json represents the results from CMS32 without using doPretty: true
and was made by doing JSON.stringify(visit1EdResults, null, 2) after putting a breakpoint
in cqm-execution/spec/models/calculator_spec.js on branch bonnie_backend_execution_results_stub
and removing the doPretty: true option passed into the calculator.
