// Teaspoon includes some support files, but you can use anything from your own support path too.
// require support/jasmine-jquery-1.7.0
// require support/jasmine-jquery-2.0.0
//= require ../../vendor/assets/components/jquery/jquery.js
// require ./helpers/jasmine-jquery-2.1.1.js

//= require_tree ./vendor
//= require_tree ./helpers

// require_tree ./integration
// require_tree ./models
// require_tree ./views

// require ./app/assets/javascripts/application.js.coffee
// require support/sinon
// require support/your-support-file
//
// PhantomJS (Teaspoons default driver) doesn't have support for Function.prototype.bind, which has caused confusion.
// Use this polyfill to avoid the confusion.
//= require support/phantomjs-shims
//
// You can require your own javascript files here. By default this will include everything in application, however you
// may get better load performance if you require the specific files that are being used in the spec that tests them.
//= require application

//= require_tree ./setup


//
// Deferring execution
// If you're using CommonJS, RequireJS or some other asynchronous library you can defer execution. Call
// Teaspoon.execute() after everything has been loaded. Simple example of a timeout:
//
// Teaspoon.defer = true
// setTimeout(Teaspoon.execute, 1000)
//
// Matching files
// By default Teaspoon will look for files that match _spec.{js,js.coffee,.coffee}. Add a filename_spec.js file in your
// spec path and it'll be included in the default suite automatically. If you want to customize suites, check out the
// configuration in teaspoon_env.rb
//
// Manifest
// If you'd rather require your spec files manually (to control order for instance) you can disable the suite matcher in
// the configuration and use this file as a manifest.
