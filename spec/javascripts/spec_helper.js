// Teaspoon includes some support files, but you can use anything from your own support path too.

//= require ../../vendor/assets/components/jquery/jquery.js

//= require_tree ./helpers

// PhantomJS (Teaspoons default driver) doesn't have support for Function.prototype.bind, which has caused confusion.
// Use this polyfill to avoid the confusion.
//= require support/phantomjs-shims

// You can require your own javascript files here. By default this will include everything in application, however you
// may get better load performance if you require the specific files that are being used in the spec that tests them.
//= require application

// Setup prepares measures to be used by specs
