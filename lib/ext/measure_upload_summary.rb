module UploadSummary

  # A measure upload refers to a record of what happened to a measure at a specific
  #  moment in time.
  # An upload has 3 parts.
  # 1 - A copy of the existing measure content in Bonnie before anything happens.
  #   This is called the archived measure.
  # 2 - Pre upload state: what did the patients associated with this measure look like
  #  prior to the upload (in terms of pass/fail).
  # 3 - Post upload state: what the patients look like after the new measure content has
  #  been uploaded into Bonnie.
  # Parts 2 and 3 are stored in upload_summaries collection.

  # This will be used to filter the calc_results object down to just population codes
  # and rationale and finalSpecifics.
