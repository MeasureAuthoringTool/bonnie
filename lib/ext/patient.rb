    # Updates the population set structure of the expected values to match the population set structure
    # on the measure.
    # If the measure has more population sets than the patient, the new population set is added to the
    # patient with zero values for each population.
    # If the measure has less population sets than the patient, extra population sets on the patient are
    # removed.
    # if a population set has additional populations in a measure, those populations are added to the
    # patient's population set with a value of zero.

    # population set are removed.
