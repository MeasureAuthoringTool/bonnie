# These rake tasks allow regression testing of the colorization code used for highlighting measures to match
# calculation results. To run them:
#
#   1) Using the code base as it looks before making any changes, run the prime_regression task, using a user
#      account with a good representative sample of measures and patients; this calculates all the patients
#      and stores the rationale and specificsRationale (used for colorization) for later use in regression
#
#   2) With the desired code changes in place, run the test_regression task using the same user account; this
#      calculates all the patients again and compares the rationale and specificsRationale against the results
#      stored in step 1
#
# Note: there's an issue when running against older patient data because the principalDiagnosis field was
# changed from a hash to an embedded class; running the bonnie:patients:resave_patient_records rake task
# before performing the regression test will prevent the problem
